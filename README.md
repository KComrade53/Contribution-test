# Contribution-test

This test was a success. I wanted to determine if work in a separate branch gets added to your GitHub profile 
contributions once the branch is merged into the master/default.

Turns out, the contributions do get counted once merged into master. So all work done on non-default branches do become contributions! :D

SUCCESS
